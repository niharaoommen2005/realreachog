        <h1>Helping Hands</h1>
        <p>
          Helping Hands is a non-profit organization committed to transforming the lives of underprivileged children. 
          Through our programs, we provide access to education, daily nutritious meals, healthcare support, 
          and skill-building workshops.  
          <br><br>
          Our vision is a world where no child is left behind, and every child gets the opportunity to 
          learn, grow, and thrive in a safe and supportive environment. We believe that by working together, 
          we can break the cycle of poverty and build a brighter future for generations to come.
